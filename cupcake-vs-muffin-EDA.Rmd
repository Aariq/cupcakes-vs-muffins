title: "Cupcake V. Muffin EDA"

Now that I have a dataset of the ingredients of many cupcake and muffin recipes, it's time for phase 2---EDA.

I already know it is a pretty sparse data set and that the number of cupcakes and muffins are not very even.


**IMPORTANT** Don't use calories with cupcake recipes because you've removed the frosting!
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Read in files
With frosting and calories
```{r}
recipes <- read_rds("recipes_tidy.rds")
nofrosting <- read_rds("nofrosting_tidy.rds")
```

# Summarise
Let's see what we're working with
```{r}
recipes %>% group_by(Type) %>% summarise(n_distinct(`Recipe ID`))
```
173 cupcake recipes and 101 muffin recipes.  If I exclude cupcake recipes with ambiguous frosting/cake designation for ingredients...
```{r}
nofrosting %>% group_by(Type) %>% summarise(n_distinct(`Recipe ID`))
```
Only 61 cupcake recipes!
