Now that I have a dataset of the ingredients of many cupcake and muffin recipes, it's time for phase 2---EDA.

I already know it is a pretty sparse data set and that the number of cupcakes and muffins are not very even.


**IMPORTANT** Don't use calories with cupcake recipes because you've removed the frosting!
